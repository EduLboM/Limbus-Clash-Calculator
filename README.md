Welcome to the Limbus Company Clashing Calculator! This program is designed to calculate the probability of victory in a game called Limbus Company. Let’s dive into how to use this program in a fun and engaging way! 🎮✨

Program Description 📝
This program simulates confrontations between allies and enemies, taking into account the base attack power, the number of coins, and the sanity of the characters. During confrontations, attacks are resolved in rounds where the character with lower power loses a coin until one side runs out of coins. The chance of coins landing heads is influenced by sanity, which ranges from -45% to +45%.

Key Features 🔍
Power Calculation: The attack power is calculated based on the base power and the number of coins.
Monte Carlo Simulations: The program performs multiple simulations to estimate win probabilities.
Clear Results: Displays final win probabilities for both allies and enemies.

How to Use the Program 🚀
Run the Program: Execute the code in your Julia programming environment.
Input Ally Data:
Base Power (BP): Your character's initial power.
Number of Coins (CN): How many coins you have.
Coin Power (CP): The value each coin adds to your power.
Sanity (SN): A value that influences the chance of coins landing heads.
Input Enemy Data:
Enemy Base Power (BPEnemy).
Number of Coins for Enemy (CNEnemy).
Coin Power for Enemy (CPEnemy).
Enemy Sanity (SNEnemy).
Set Number of Simulations: It is recommended to run 10,000+ or more simulations for more accurate results.
View Results: After execution, the program will display the final win probabilities for both you and your enemy. 🏆
